Here's a simple example of a Flutter app that demonstrates basic CRUD operations using `sqflite`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sqflite/sqflite.dart';
import 'package:path/path.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'SQFlite Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  late Future<Database> database;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Open the database when the widget initializes
    database = openDatabase(
      join(getDatabasesPath(), 'demo_database.db'),
      onCreate: (db, version) {
        return db.execute(
          "CREATE TABLE items(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, quantity INTEGER)",
        );
      },
      version: 1,
    );
  }

  Future<void> insertItem(Item item) async {
    final Database db = await database;

    await db.insert(
      'items',
      item.toMap(),
      conflictAlgorithm: ConflictAlgorithm.replace,
    );
  }

  Future<List<Item>> items() async {
    final Database db = await database;

    final List<Map<String, dynamic>> maps = await db.query('items');

    return List.generate(maps.length, (i) {
      return Item(
        id: maps[i]['id'],
        name: maps[i]['name'],
        quantity: maps[i]['quantity'],
      );
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('SQFlite Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Inserting a new item
                final newItem = Item(name: 'New Item', quantity: 1);
                insertItem(newItem);
              },
              child: Text('Add Item'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            FutureBuilder<List<Item>>(
              future: items(),
              builder: (context, snapshot) {
                if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
                  return CircularProgressIndicator();
                }
                if (snapshot.hasError) {
                  return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
                }
                return Column(
                  children: snapshot.data!.map((item) {
                    return ListTile(
                      title: Text(item.name),
                      subtitle: Text('Quantity: ${item.quantity}'),
                    );
                  }).toList(),
                );
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class Item {
  final int? id;
  final String name;
  final int quantity;

  Item({this.id, required this.name, required this.quantity});

  Map<String, dynamic> toMap() {
    return {
      'id': id,
      'name': name,
      'quantity': quantity,
    };
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates a simple Flutter app with a `MyHomePage` widget that displays a list of items. You can add items to the list by clicking the "Add Item" button. The items are stored in a SQLite database using `sqflite`. The database is created when the app starts and contains a single table called "items" with columns for the item's name and quantity.
